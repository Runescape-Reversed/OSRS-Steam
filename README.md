# OSRS-Steam 
A solo project to reverse engineer critical parts of the OSRS Steam client. The OSRS steam client is a real native port of the OSRS client, using directx.
Unlike the NXT client for RS3, structure is mostly unchanged here. Anyone experienced with the engine and native assembly will have an easier time working 
with this than the old client. Overall it's a pleasent surprise, and I suspect a complete reverse engineering attempt back to C++ would be easy if someone 
cared enough.
